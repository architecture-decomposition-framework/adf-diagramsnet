# adf-diagramsnet

The ADF elements available for creating diagrams in diagrams.net

## Quick start

Use [this link](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&libs=general&clibs=Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Farchitecture-decomposition-framework%2Fadf-diagramsnet%2Fmain%2Flibraries%2FADF_SW%40RT.xml;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Farchitecture-decomposition-framework%2Fadf-diagramsnet%2Fmain%2Flibraries%2FADF_Env%40RT.xml;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Farchitecture-decomposition-framework%2Fadf-diagramsnet%2Fmain%2Flibraries%2FADF_SW%40DT.xml;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Farchitecture-decomposition-framework%2Fadf-diagramsnet%2Fmain%2Flibraries%2FADF_Env%40DT.xml) to open a blank diagram in the online version of diagrams.net that has the four different ACES ADF palettes ("libraries") available.

## Offline use

Download the xml files in [`libraries/`](./libraries) and load them as libraries in diagrams.net/draw.io via File -> Open library.

## Working on the libraries

In [`source/`](./source), there is a .drawio-file with all the elements that are used to generate the libraries. See Wiki of this project for more information on how to edit the file and libraries.
